                    Christ the Redeemer is a colossal statue of Jesus Christ that stands atop Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Completed in 1931, the statue was designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French sculptor Paul Landowski.

            Parque Lage, officially known as Parque Enrique Lage, is a public park located in the Jardim Botânico neighborhood at the foot of Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

In the 1920s, the mansion on the property was remodeled by Italian architect Mario Vodret, with interior paintings by Salvador Payols Sabaté. The park was listed as a historical and cultural heritage site for the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1957 and became a public park in the 1960s.The park is located at the foot of Corcovado Mountain, making it very close to the Christ the Redeemer statue.</div>

                    <div class="info">Copacabana Fort, also known as Forte de Copacabana, is a historic military base located at the southern end of Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The fort was constructed between 1908 and 1914 to protect the city and its harbor from potential naval attacks. It features two large armored cupolas, each housing Krupp cannons, which were considered state-of-the-art at the time. The fort played a significant role in Brazilian history, particularly during the 1922 Copacabana Fort revolt, which was part of the tenentista movement against the government.</div>
